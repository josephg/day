//! day-piece-webview — an EXTERNAL Day Piece (DESIGN.md §15) wrapping each toolkit's NATIVE web view:
//! WKWebView on AppKit/UIKit, QWebEngineView on Qt, `android.webkit.WebView` on Android. One Rust API
//! registered link-time into each backend's renderer slice without touching day. Alongside the
//! picker it's a reference for pieces that carry both a front-end AND their own native backend — here
//! including an Android manifest permission contribution (INTERNET), see docs/extending.md.
//!
//! The view is a growing leaf that fills its space. Navigation is imperative and modeled with `Copy`
//! `Trigger`s — `.go()` loads the bound URL, `.back()`/`.forward()`/`.stop()`/`.reload()` drive
//! history — each `watch`ed to a `WebPatch`. The bound URL is two-way: `.go()` loads it, and native
//! navigation reports the current URL back so a bound text field follows along.
