// Web (web-dom): an `<iframe>`.
//
// The one backend with no browser engine to embed, because the host page already is one. An iframe
// displays a URL faithfully; everything beyond that is governed by the same-origin policy, which
// forbids a parent document from reading or driving a cross-origin child. Three consequences, all
// documented in docs/webview.md:
//
// - **Session history is unreachable.** `contentWindow.history.back()` throws `SecurityError` on a
//   cross-origin frame, so `Back` and `Forward` are no-ops. Driving the TOP-level history instead
//   would be worse than doing nothing: day's web router owns that stack (`pushState` on hash
//   routes), so a "back" press would navigate the app off the page hosting the frame.
// - **A load cannot be cancelled.** `contentWindow.stop()` is blocked for the same reason.
// - **Navigation does not report back.** Reading `contentWindow.location.href` throws, so the URL
//   binding is one-way here: `.go()` loads the field's value, but the field does not follow the
//   user's clicks inside the frame. `Reload` therefore re-loads the last URL day itself set, not
//   wherever the frame has since navigated to.
//
// Same-origin content has none of these limits, but a piece cannot know the origin before loading
// and the failure is silent when it guesses wrong, so this arm reports `Support::Emulated` and
// behaves identically either way rather than working only sometimes. An app gates its history
// controls on `day_piece_webview::support()`.
//
// A cross-origin frame that refuses embedding (`X-Frame-Options`, CSP `frame-ancestors`) renders
// blank, and the parent cannot detect it — the load event fires either way. That is the browser's
// policy, not day's, and no arm of this piece can report it.
